# ShelfShare - A Salesforce-based Online Library for Sharing Printed Books

ShelfShare is an online version of a traditional library designed to make it easy and accessible for users to search for and borrow printed books. 
Here, every user can not only find and borrow a book for a certain period but also lend their books to others.

This work was developed as part of bachelor's thesis.
